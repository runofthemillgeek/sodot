# Sodot

This world... needs more todo apps.

This is just another simple todos app made with React and Redux. No other deps other than the ones that come with `create-react-app`.

## How do I run this? (to future me)

With `yarn`,
```
$ yarn         # install deps
$ yarn start   # start webpack-dev-server
```

With `npm`,
```
$ npm i        # install deps
$ npm start    # start webpack-dev-server
```
